# Resume RAG System

**AI-Powered Semantic Resume Search Platform**

A sophisticated Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) system that transforms resume screening through advanced vector embeddings and semantic search capabilities. This platform enables intelligent candidate matching by understanding the contextual meaning of skills, experience, and qualifications rather than relying on simple keyword matching.

## Overview

The Resume RAG System leverages cutting-edge natural language processing and vector database technology to create a semantic understanding of resume content. By converting resumes into high-dimensional vector embeddings, the system can identify candidates whose experience and skills semantically align with job requirements, even when exact keywords don't match.

### How It Works

1. **Vector Embedding Generation**: Each resume is processed through advanced language models to create dense vector representations that capture semantic meaning
2. **FAISS Vector Database**: Resumes are stored as searchable vectors in a high-performance FAISS index for lightning-fast similarity search
3. **Semantic Query Processing**: Job descriptions and search queries are converted to the same vector space for accurate matching
4. **AI-Powered Ranking**: Retrieved candidates are evaluated and ranked using large language models with comprehensive scoring criteria
5. **Interactive Results**: Candidates are presented with detailed explanations, match scores, and reasoning

### Key Advantages Over Traditional Systems

**Semantic Understanding vs Keyword Matching**
- Traditional systems miss qualified candidates who use different terminology
- Our system understands that "machine learning engineer" relates to "data scientist" and "AI researcher"
- Captures skills transferability and role equivalencies across industries

**Context-Aware Matching**
- Considers experience progression, career trajectory, and skill combinations
- Understands industry context and role requirements
- Evaluates cultural and functional fit beyond technical qualifications

**Explainable AI Decisions**
- Provides detailed reasoning for each candidate match
- Transparent scoring across multiple evaluation dimensions
- Helps recruiters make informed decisions with AI insights

## Technical Architecture

### Vector Embedding Pipeline
```
Resume Documents → Text Processing → Language Model → Vector Embeddings → FAISS Index
```

**Core Components:**
- **OpenAI Embeddings**: State-of-the-art text-embedding-3-small model for semantic representation
- **FAISS Vector Store**: Facebook AI Similarity Search for efficient nearest neighbor retrieval
- **LangChain Integration**: Streamlined document processing and retrieval workflows
- **Multi-dimensional Scoring**: Comprehensive candidate evaluation across 8+ criteria

### Search Architecture
```
Natural Language Query → Vector Embedding → Similarity Search → Document Retrieval → LLM Scoring → Ranked Results
```

**Search Process:**
1. Query vectorization using the same embedding model as resume corpus
2. Cosine similarity search across the vector database
3. Top-K retrieval of most semantically similar resumes
4. Intelligent re-ranking using large language model evaluation
5. Structured output with scores, reasoning, and detailed candidate profiles

### Option 1: Demo Mode (No Setup Required)
Experience the full functionality without any configuration:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/dataohmine/matchbot
cd matchbot

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Initialize demo data
python setup_demo.py

# Launch application
streamlit run app.py
```

Access the application at `http://localhost:8501` and try these example searches:

### Option 2: Production Mode (OpenAI API Required)
For real resume databases with unlimited search capabilities:

```bash
# Follow demo setup steps above, then:

# Configure your OpenAI API key
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env file: OPENAI_API_KEY=your_actual_api_key_here

# Launch with full AI capabilities
streamlit run app.py
```

### Option 3: Docker Deployment
```bash
# One-command deployment
docker-compose up --build

# Access at http://localhost:8501
```
